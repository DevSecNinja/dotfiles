#Requires -Version 5.1
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a self-signed code signing certificate for PowerShell scripts.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script generates a self-signed certificate that can be used to sign PowerShell
    scripts in GitHub Actions. It exports the certificate as a PFX file and converts it
    to base64 for easy storage in GitHub Secrets.

.PARAMETER SubjectName
    The subject name for the certificate (e.g., "Your Name" or "CN=Your Name").
    If not provided, uses the chezmoi configured name or prompts for input.

.PARAMETER Password
    The password to protect the certificate (minimum 8 characters). This parameter is mandatory
    and will prompt securely if not provided on the command line.

.EXAMPLE
    .\New-SigninCert.ps1
    Prompts for password securely (SubjectName uses chezmoi default).

.EXAMPLE
    .\New-SigninCert.ps1 -SubjectName "John Doe"
    Creates a certificate for "John Doe" and prompts for password.

.EXAMPLE
    $securePass = ConvertTo-SecureString "MyStrongPassword123!" -AsPlainText -Force
    .\New-SigninCert.ps1 -SubjectName "John Doe" -Password $securePass
    Creates a certificate with provided subject name and password (non-interactive).

.NOTES
    This script must be run on Windows with PowerShell 5.1 or later.
    Run as Administrator for best compatibility.
